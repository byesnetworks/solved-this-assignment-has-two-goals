This assignment has two goals:  1) have students increase their understanding of the concept of Protecting Personal Information (PPI) and other ethical issues related to the use of information technology through research, and 2) learn to correctly incorporate citations and references in APA format. Students may use the tools and techniques within Word to format the research paper, including use of the References and citation tools. These skills will be valuable throughout a student’s academic career.  The paper will require a title page, NO abstract, three to four <u>full</u> pages of content with incorporation of a minimum of 3 external resources from credible sources and a Works Cited/References page.  Wikipedia and similar general information sites, blogs or discussion groups are not considered creditable sources for a research project.  No more than 10% of the paper may be in the form of a direct citation from an external source.

<strong>Topic for Research Paper</strong>

* The Apple vs. FBI controversy over unlocking the iPhone




<strong>Writing Quality for the Research Paper</strong>

* All Grammar, Verb Tenses, Pronouns, Spelling, Punctuation, and Writing Competency should be without error.

* Be particularly careful about mis-matching a noun and pronoun. For example, if you say “A person does this…” then do not use “their” or “they” when referring to that person. “Person” is singular; “their” or “they” is plural.

* Remember: <em>there </em>is not <em>their</em>, <em>your </em>is not <em>you’re</em>, <em>its </em>is not <em>it’s</em>, <em>too </em>is not <em>to </em>or <em>two</em>, <em>site </em>is not <em>cite</em>, and <em>who </em>should be used after an individual, not <em>that</em>. For example, “the person WHO made the speech” not “the person THAT made the speech.”

*  In a professional paper one does not use contractions (doesn’t, don’t, etc.) and one does not use the personal <em>I,</em> <em>you </em>or <em>your</em>. Use the impersonal as in the previous sentence. It is more business-like to say “In a professional paper one should not use contractions,” rather than saying, “In a professional paper you don’t use contractions.”

*Remember: spell-check, then proofread. Better yet, have a friend or colleague read it before submitting it. Read it out loud to yourself. Read it as if you are submitting it to your boss.
